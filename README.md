# webgl-showcase
WebGL programs that I have written and published on my website at http://sci.filin.fi/showcase

- Files represent complete web apps, as appearing on my website.
- Programs use [kangas-lib](https://github.com/idofilin/kangas-lib), a common helper library that I have written (files
  prefixed with `kangas-`,  and `Kangas` namespace (global object)
  in the browser's javascript environment).
  
- The project contains a third-party minimized script for building Voronoi diagrams. The script is copyrighted `(C) 2010-2013 Raymond Hill`, released under MIT license, and its source code is available at https://github.com/gorhill/Javascript-Voronoi/.
- The `galaxy-small.jpg` image is by the `European Space Agency / Hubble Space Telescope`, and made available under `CC-BY-3.0` license (see http://www.spacetelescope.org/copyright/).
